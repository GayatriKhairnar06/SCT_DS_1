##📊 Categorical and Continuous Variable Analysis
This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs basic data analysis on a dataset of COVID-19 deaths. It demonstrates how to handle different types of variables—categorical and continuous—and presents an initial data exploration.

##📁 Project Contents
Categorical_and_Continuous_Variable.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook that contains all the analysis code.

Provisional_COVID-19_Deaths_by_Sex_and_Age.csv: The raw dataset used for this analysis.

##🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this notebook, you need to have Python and a few key libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install pandas matplotlib

How to Run
Place the Categorical_and_Continuous_Variable.ipynb and Provisional_COVID-19_Deaths_by_Sex_and_Age.csv files in the same directory.

Open the Jupyter Notebook.

Run the cells in the notebook from top to bottom. The code will load the data, perform the analysis, and display the results.

##📝 Analysis Details
The notebook includes a series of steps to analyze the data, which may include:

Data Loading: Reading the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.

Initial Exploration: Using methods like df.head() to inspect the first few rows of the data.

Variable Identification: Identifying which columns are categorical (e.g., sex, age group) and which are continuous (e.g., number of deaths).

Data Cleaning: Handling any missing values or data inconsistencies.

🔗 Dataset Information
The data for this project is sourced from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Dataset Name: Provisional COVID-19 Deaths by Sex and Age
