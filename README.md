Categorical and Continuous Variable Analysis
This project contains a Jupyter Notebook (Categorical_and_Continuous_Variable.ipynb) that demonstrates basic data analysis techniques using Python. The notebook reads a CSV file containing data on COVID-19 deaths and performs initial exploration.

Project Files
Categorical_and_Continuous_Variable.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook file. It uses pandas and matplotlib.pyplot for data manipulation and visualization.

Provisional_COVID-19_Deaths_by_Sex_and_Age.csv: The dataset used in the notebook. This file contains provisional data on COVID-19 deaths, broken down by sex and age.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this notebook, you will need to have the following Python libraries installed:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

matplotlib: For creating visualizations.

You can install them using pip:

pip install pandas matplotlib

Running the Notebook
Make sure you have both the .ipynb and .csv files in the same directory.

Open the Jupyter Notebook.

Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to see the code execution and output.

Code Description
The notebook performs the following main tasks:

Import Libraries: Imports the necessary pandas and matplotlib.pyplot libraries.

Load Data: Reads the Provisional_COVID-19_Deaths_by_Sex_and_Age.csv file into a pandas DataFrame.

Data Exploration: Prints the head of the DataFrame to get a quick overview of the data structure and content.

This project serves as a foundational example for beginners to work with real-world datasets and perform simple data exploration.
